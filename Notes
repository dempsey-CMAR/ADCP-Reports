Please note:

There are no reports for 2019-01-17_Grand Passage, 2007-07-19_Lennox Passage,
and 2019-12-14_Superlease, as CMAR does not appear to have the raw data. (resolved)

NSDFA tracking sheet says that 2008-07-31_Freeport may have questionable data.
(resolved; checked and determined the data was fine)

The reports for 2019-02-07_Camerons Cove, 2021-09-01_Lazares Island,
2020-07-08_St. Peters Inlet, 2020-06-15_The Brothers South,
2021-09-01_Walshs Deep Cove, and 2020-09-01_Woods Harbour will need to be
redone as the caption for the station map indicates the existence of a lease
that is not shown on the map. (resolved)

The close-up maps for Brier Island, Brier Island E, and Superlease need to be
zoomed in, while those for Brandy Ledge, Center Bay, and Blandford need to be
zoomed out. (resolved)

Figure 31 in 2011-03-30_Brier Island and figure 57 in 2020-10-22_Cornwallis NE
show warning messages and need to be fixed. (resolved; fixed in package)

Several reports show "Range_1" up to "Range_13" instead of a proper key for some
of the current rose plots. The reports that have this problem with at least
one plot are Spectacle Island (2007), Spectacle Island (2008), Port Mouton Island,
Freeport, Coffin Island SW, Owl's Head, East McNutts, Jordan Bay, Borgles Island,
Beaver Harbour, Eddy Cove Center, North Aberdeen (2017), Superlease, South Aberdeen (2018),
Spectacle Island (2018), Ram Island, Brandy Ledge, Meal Rock, Black Island, Nyanza,
Loon Point, Pilot Point, Prices Island, Sober Island Outlet, Blue Island,
Outer Wine Harbour, Big Gooseberry Island, The Brothers South, Boston Rock,
Shut-in Island, Canoe Island, Blandford, Cornwallis NE, Wolfes Island, Lazares Island,
and Walshs Deep Cove. (appears to be resolved; fixed in package)

With most of the deployments, one or more depths (usually the most shallow) will
have only a few observations. The report for Hunts Point is an extreme example
of this. (resolved; this is not a problem)

For a few reports (such as Eddy Cove Center), the Depth row in the deployment details
table is left blank (due to an empty entry in the NSDFA tracking sheet). When this is
the case, the row should say "Not recorded" instead. (resolved; fixed in package)
